# Proxy Servers

This repository contains a simple HTTP proxy server implemented in four different programming languages: Python, Go, Java, and C++. Each implementation is located in its respective directory and includes its own README with instructions on how to compile, run, and test the proxy server.

## What is a Proxy Server?

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a destination server. When a client (such as a web browser) makes a request for resources, the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the destination server, retrieves the resource, and sends it back to the client.

### How Proxy Servers Work

1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request to the proxy server instead of directly to the target server. This request can be for web pages, files, or any other resource available on the internet.

2. **Proxy Forwarding**: The proxy server receives the request and, depending on its configuration, forwards it to the appropriate destination server.

3. **Server Response**: The destination server processes the request and sends the response back to the proxy server.

4. **Proxy Response**: The proxy server forwards the server's response to the client.

### Types of Proxy Servers

- **Forward Proxy**: Typically used by clients to access resources on the internet. It hides the client's IP address from the destination server.
  
- **Reverse Proxy**: Typically used by servers to manage incoming client requests. It hides the server's IP address from the client and can provide load balancing and security features.

- **Transparent Proxy**: The client and the server are unaware of the proxy's presence. It does not modify requests and responses and is often used for content filtering.

- **Anonymous Proxy**: The proxy server hides the client's IP address from the destination server, providing anonymity for the client.

### Why Use a Proxy Server?

- **Security**: Proxy servers can provide a layer of security by filtering traffic, blocking harmful content, and protecting against attacks.

- **Anonymity**: By hiding the client's IP address, proxy servers can help maintain anonymity while browsing the web.

- **Content Filtering**: Organizations often use proxy servers to restrict access to certain types of content, enforcing internet usage policies.

- **Caching**: Proxy servers can cache frequently requested resources, reducing load times and saving bandwidth.

- **Load Balancing**: Reverse proxies can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving performance and reliability.

## Why Implement This Proxy Server?

Implementing a proxy server from scratch can be a valuable exercise for several reasons:

- **Learning Experience**: By building a proxy server, you gain hands-on experience with network programming, socket communication, and multi-threading or concurrency. This deepens your understanding of how internet communication works at a low level.

- **Understanding Different Languages**: Implementing the same functionality in multiple languages allows you to compare how different programming languages handle networking, concurrency, and I/O operations. It can also improve your proficiency in these languages.

- **Custom Solutions**: Sometimes, existing proxy solutions may not meet your specific needs. Building your own proxy server allows you to create a customized solution tailored to your requirements, whether it's for security, performance, or specific features.

- **Performance Optimization**: By implementing a proxy server, you can experiment with different approaches to optimize performance. This includes choosing the right data structures, managing connections efficiently, and utilizing concurrency models appropriate for your use case.

- **Security and Control**: Building your own proxy server gives you complete control over its behavior. You can implement custom security measures, logging, access controls, and other features that may not be available in off-the-shelf solutions.

- **Understanding of Protocols**: Writing a proxy server forces you to understand the HTTP protocol (and potentially others) in detail. This knowledge is crucial for roles in web development, security, and network engineering.

- **Professional Development**: For developers, understanding how to build and manage proxy servers is a valuable skill that can be applied in various professional settings, including network administration, cybersecurity, and backend development.

## Languages

- **Python**: A straightforward implementation using `socket` and `threading`. The Python proxy server is simple to set up and serves as a good starting point for understanding proxy servers.
- **Go**: An implementation that leverages Go's concurrency model with `goroutines`. The Go proxy server is efficient and handles multiple connections concurrently, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
- **Java**: A multi-threaded implementation using Java's standard libraries. The Java proxy server is robust and widely applicable, suitable for enterprise-level applications.
- **C++**: A multi-threaded implementation using `std::thread`. The C++ proxy server provides low-level control and high performance, ideal for scenarios where resource management is critical.

## Usage

Each language implementation can be found in its respective directory. Refer to the individual README files for instructions specific to that language.
