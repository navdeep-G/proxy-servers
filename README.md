# Proxy Servers

This repository contains a simple HTTP proxy server implemented in four different programming languages: Python, Go, Java, and C++. Each implementation is located in its respective directory and includes its own README with instructions on how to compile, run, and test the proxy server.

## Languages

- **Python**: A straightforward implementation using `socket` and `threading`.
- **Go**: An implementation that leverages Go's concurrency model with `goroutines`.
- **Java**: A multi-threaded implementation using Java's standard libraries.
- **C++**: A multi-threaded implementation using `std::thread`.

## Usage

Each language implementation can be found in its respective directory. Refer to the individual README files for instructions specific to that language.
